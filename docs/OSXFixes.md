# `MRP.OSXFixes`

If you are using the `rmmv-mrp-core.js` bundle then these are loaded
automatically if needed.

What this fixes:

- Copy + Paste now works inside devtools. (!!!)
- Moves the devtools window over a little bit so that its menu bar is visible.
  (YanFly's Core plugin moves this to the 0, 0 position on the screen, which
  makes this window impossible to move.)
